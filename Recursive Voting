You are given a list of integers votes representing election votes for candidates a and b. Each element in votes represents
a vote to one of the two candidates:

If votes[i] < 0, then it's a vote for a.
If votes[i] â‰¥ n, then it's a vote for b.
Otherwise, the vote at index i made the same vote as votes[votes[i]].
Return the number of votes that candidate a received. You can assume all votes are eventually made to either a or b.


int find(int node,vector<int> &votes,int n){
    if(votes[node]<0 || votes[node]>=n) return votes[node];
    return votes[node]=find(votes[node],votes,n);
}
int solve(vector<int>& votes) {
    int n=votes.size();

    int count=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(votes[i]>=0 && votes[i]<n) votes[i]=find(i,votes,n);
        if(votes[i]<0) count++;
    }
    return count;
}
